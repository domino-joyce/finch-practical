#Darwin’s finches- the Data			

You have a dataset (download from Canvas) which consists of beak depth measurements (in mm) for a large number of adult birds. Open it in excel and have a look at it. The first two columns are parent-offspring beak depths. You can use these to see if there is an association between parent and offspring beak depths, and therefore get an idea of how heritable the trait is.

The third column is beak depths for 216 adult wild birds, measured in 1977. The fourth column is the fitness of those birds- a zero indicates that they didn’t reproduce, a 1 indicates that they did. The fifth column contains the beak depths of the offspring from the fourth column (136 birds).

Finally, I have included some beak depth data from the same species but a population from another island- El Garruptero. These data were collected in 2004. (The paper these data are from actually uses principal components rather than beak depth, so the data combine a number of traits. For simplicity and consistency, I have interpreted it for this practical as beak depth, since beak depth is the major contributor to principal component 1).
